# Design Patterns
Design Patterns are solutions created for common problems in software. They can be thought of as pre-made plans that can be customized and used to solve common problems in code. Design patterns are general concepts used for problem solving, not parts that can be found ready-made, such as a function or class, and added to the code.

# Factory Design Pattern
Factory Design Pattern requires designing an interface for object creation and allows subclasses to produce objects. In addition, the subclasses themselves determine which class object will be created. Thus it abstracts the object creation process. It is one of the creative design patterns and is frequently used in software.
