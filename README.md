# Design Patterns
Design Patterns are solutions created for common problems in software. They can be thought of as pre-made plans that can be customized and used to solve common problems in code. Design patterns are general concepts used for problem solving, not parts that can be found ready-made, such as a function or class, and added to the code.

## Factory Design Pattern
Factory Design Pattern requires designing an interface for object creation and allows subclasses to produce objects. In addition, the subclasses themselves determine which class object will be created. Thus it abstracts the object creation process. It is one of the creative design patterns and is frequently used in software.

[See Example](https://github.com/ProgrammingLessons/DesignPatterns/tree/main/Factory "Go to Factory Design Pattern")

## Abstract Factory Design Pattern
Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern, which solves the problem of creating entire product families without specifying their concrete classes. Abstract Factory defines an interface for creating all distinct products but leaves the actual product creation to concrete factory classes. Each factory type corresponds to a certain product variety.

[See Example](https://github.com/ProgrammingLessons/DesignPatterns/tree/main/AbstractFactory "Go to Abstract Factory Design Pattern")

## Singleton Design Pattern
A singleton is used to ensure that there is only one instance of an object and that the same (and only one instance) is called everywhere in your code whenever you need that object.

[See Example](https://github.com/ProgrammingLessons/DesignPatterns/tree/main/SingletonDesignPattern "Go to Singleton Design Pattern")

## Composite Design Pattern
Composite is a structural design pattern that allows composing objects into a tree-like structure and work with the it as if it was a singular object.

[See Example](https://github.com/ProgrammingLessons/DesignPatterns/tree/main/CompositeDesignPattern "Go to Composite Design Pattern")

## Decorator Design Pattern
Decorator pattern allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without altering its structure. This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern acts as a wrapper to existing class.

This pattern creates a decorator class which wraps the original class and provides additional functionality keeping class methods signature intact.

[See Example](https://github.com/ProgrammingLessons/DesignPatterns/tree/main/DecoratorDesignPattern "Go to Decorator Design Pattern")

## Chain Of Responsibility Design Pattern
Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to pass requests along a chain of handlers. After receiving a request, each handler decides to process the request or forward it to the next handler in the chain.

[See Example](https://github.com/ProgrammingLessons/DesignPatterns/tree/main/ChainOfResponsibilityDesignPattern "Go to Chain Of Responsibility Design Pattern")

## Command Design Pattern
Command is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, delay or queue a request’s execution, and support undoable operations.

[See Example](https://github.com/ProgrammingLessons/DesignPatterns/tree/main/CommandDesignPattern "Go to Command Design Pattern")

## Mediator Design Pattern
Mediator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you reduce chaotic dependencies between objects. The pattern restricts direct communications between the objects and forces them to collaborate only via a mediator object.

[See Example](https://github.com/ProgrammingLessons/DesignPatterns/tree/main/MediatorDesignPattern "Go to Mediator Design Pattern")

## Strategy Design Pattern
Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that turns a set of behaviors into objects and makes them interchangeable inside original context object.
