# Factory Design Pattern
Factory Design Pattern requires designing an interface for object creation and allows subclasses to produce objects. In addition, the subclasses themselves determine which class object will be created. Thus it abstracts the object creation process. It is one of the creative design patterns and is frequently used in software.
